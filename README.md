# Leveraging high frequency data for improving crop growth estimates

This repository contains the code used in my PhD project. It includes data preparation, model calibration, assimilation, evaluation and visualization strategies used. It also includes some support tables required for running simulations.

Raw data may be found in [this repository](https://doi.org/10.25824/redu/EP4NGO).

It is worth noting that the results from my thesis have been revisited and I refer readers to the manuscripts for updated results of the project.
